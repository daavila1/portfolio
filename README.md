# Portfolio - Daniel A. Avila G.

MSc Student - Mobility Engineering - Politecnico di Milano

## About me
Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Mobility Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, building on my background as a Civil Engineer. Throughout my academic journey I've had the opportunity to explore different areas of transportation, mobility, and data analysis, including statistics, simulation, and machine learning. I've applied these skills to better understand mobility systems and evaluate strategies for improving their performance.

During my studies I also conducted research at Purdue University, where I developed my undergraduate thesis. This experience gave me the chance to work in an academic research environment, applying simulation and modeling methods to real transportation challenges. It strengthened my ability to translate complex data into practical insights and deepened my understanding of transportation systems analysis.

I am passionate about using simulation and modeling to better understand how transportation systems work and how they can be improved. I have developed experience with PTV Visum and SUMO, applying them to build, calibrate, and validate traffic models at both mesoscopic and microscopic scale. To complement this, I have also worked with TraCI, PTV Vissim, PTV Vistro, Python and GIS for scenario testing, data analysis, and visualization. This toolkit has allowed me to translate complex data into practical insights, and it is the foundation I am eager to expand on in my professional career.

Beyond my formal studies, I am very interested in data analysis and machine learning. I enjoy exploring these fields through side projects and hands-on experimentation, often using Python to test ideas, analyze data, and visualize results. I have also gained experience in web programming, which I use to develop small personal projects that combine technical skills with creative problem-solving.

This portfolio is a space to showcase some of the projects I have worked on. It reflects not only my technical expertise but also my collaborative skills and my curiosity to explore solutions across different domains.

## Projects
### **1. Building and Calibration of Microscopic Simulation Models for the Assessment of Traffic Control Strategies**
*[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/daavila1/sumo-traffic-signal-control-simulation)*

Developed and calibrated a microscopic simulation using ***SUMO*** to evaluate different traffic signal control strategies. The project involved creating a high-fidelity corridor network from OSM data, generating traffic demand from field counts, and calibrating the model. Four control strategies were tested, including fixed-time and actuated plans, with optimization performed in ***PTV VISTRO***. Simulations were executed with ***Python*** and ***TraCI*** for real-time data collection, analyzing key performance metrics such as delay, travel time, and number of stops.

### **2. Resilience Assesment of Milan's Road Network Under Flooding Scenarios**
*[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/daavila1/resilience-assessment-milano-road-network-under-flood-scenarios)*

Evaluated the resilience of Milan's road transport network to flooding of the Lambro River, with a focus on the Tangenziale Est corridor. The project combined ***Python*** for demand-side analysis and visualization, **GIS** for flood exposure mapping, and ***PTV Visum*** for scenario modeling. Baseline and disrupted scenarios were developed to capture both high- and moderate-disruption events, applying flood depth-speed relationships from literature to simulate network impacts.

Performance indicators such as travel times, vehicle speeds, and demand distribution were compared across scenarios to assess system vulnerability. Mitigation strategies were tested, ranging from short-term traffic management measures to long-term infrastructural solutions like water retention basins.

### **3. Fashion MNIST Classification - Closet Tune**
*[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/daavila1/closet-tune-app)*

Developed a ***machine learning pipeline*** for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The project covers the full workflow from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation, all documented in the Closet Tune Jupyter Notebook.

Additionally, an interactive ***Flask*** web app was created to test the models in real time. Users can upload an image or draw directly on a canvas to receive predictions from all four machine learning models, providing a hands-on demonstration of model performance and interactivity.
